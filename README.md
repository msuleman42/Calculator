# Calculator
A slightly simplified calculator that handles input expressions as strings. The calculator can take in string expressions of any length. If the expression is invalid it returns the Float.MIN_VALUE. Expressions must have a space between each operator and operand (e.g. -3+9/2 must be written as "-3 + 9 / 2"). It also accepts brackets and uses BODMAS to evaluate the expression. The calculator also holds memory values. And a value can also be stored by the user.
